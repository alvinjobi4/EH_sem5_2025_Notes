What Shodan Reveals for scanme.nmap.org
Using Shodan’s host data (via the Shodan website or API), here's what a user would typically see:
•	IP Address & Hostnames — including reverse DNS and associated domains.
•	Open Ports & Protocols — e.g. TCP ports such as 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), 9929 (nping echo), etc.
•	Service Banners — product names and versions (e.g. OpenSSH 5.3p1, Apache httpd 2.2.14 on Ubuntu)
•	Operating System Fingerprint & Device Type — guesses like Linux vs. other OS, based on fingerprinting data.
•	TTL and scan timestamps — indicating when Shodan last probed the host.
•	Possibly additional metadata — tags, SSL certificate info, CVEs if known, and screenshots for certain protocols (if applicable) 
For instance, scanning scanme.nmap.org with Nmap using the Shodan API script would output something like:
| shodan‑api: Report for scanme.nmap.org
| PORT  PROTO  PRODUCT      VERSION
| 80    tcp    Apache httpd
| 22    tcp    OpenSSH      5.3p1 Debian …
| 9929  tcp    Nping echo

How This Data Can Be Used
For Defenders (Security Practitioners)
•	Passive discovery of exposure: You can see exactly what services your host is exposing publicly, without even scanning it yourself.
•	Drift detection: If Shodan’s snapshot shows ports or services that aren't currently active during your internal scan, this may indicate recent changes or intermittent configuration (e.g. a service left open occasionally)
•	Prioritize remediation: With product and version info, you can map open services to CVEs and decide which services need patching.
•	Automate alerting: Monitor IPs or domains and get notified when Shodan updates expose a new service or vulnerability.
For Attackers (Threat Actors / Red Teamers)
•	Quick recon: Shodan lets an attacker see open ports, service versions, and OS fingerprinting without ever interacting with the actual host—speedy and stealthy.
•	Target prioritization: Spot known vulnerable software (e.g. old versions of OpenSSH or Apache) to craft targeted exploits.
•	Historical view: Sometimes the database shows services that were recently shut down. These may reveal assets that were exposed but disabled during active pentests. Attackers can plan based on that history.
•	Attack path planning: Combine Shodan metadata—port + banner + possible CVE—to determine the best initial attack vector.
